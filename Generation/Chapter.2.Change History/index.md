# Change History #

### Alpha Phase #


Following internal review and assurance, the Wave 1 and 2 Events have been removed and new Child Health Events added for the Alpha version of the specification.


### Experimental Phase #

When referring to the pack, please note that the current approach to profiling the events is applied to the Wave 2 events. 

The Wave 1 events used an initial approach experimenting with the different profiling options with the initial set of requirements. These Wave 1 events will be changed to use the profiling approach in Wave 2 events, and also because the information requirements they are intended to support will have changed since their creation. Where a Care Connect profile has been used, elements have not been profiled out. Where changes have been made, these are intended to support requirements that are specific to Child Health event messages.
