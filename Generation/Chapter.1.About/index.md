###Overview: Implementation Guide for Digital Child Health  FHIR Messaging#

This is FHIR Domain Message Specifications (DMS) to support the following care communications for the Child Health Events Catalogue. 

**What is an Event?**

Events contain information meaningful to those managing the personal health of themselves or their families, those professionals providing direct care to children and young people and those managing the health of populations.

The information contained within an event is recorded within clinical interventions or occurrences that happen throughout a clinical pathway or patient journey. These clinical interventions or occurrences are referenced throughout the catalogue and are classed as a form of clinical contact either as part of the Healthy Child Programme which is a planned intervention as part of the pathway, or unplanned such as a visit to a GP or Emergency Department. 

To ensure the aims of this strategy are met and small manageable segments of data are interoperable the events catalogue breaks up the much larger Clinical Interventions/Occurrences into a smaller, more manageable 'events'.

**Note:** This DMS is published as a **'work in progress'** version and as such is subject to change.  It has been published to show the direction of travel and serve as a discussion document for parties involved with the implementation of FHIR based messages. 

**Further Information**
This FHIR Messaging specification is based on and intended to be used alongside the published [FHIR DSTU2 1.0.1] (Sept 2015) specification.
